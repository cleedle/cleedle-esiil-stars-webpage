Major: Environmental Science   

My name is Celeste Leedle. I am currently an intern with ESIIL Stars. I am from Twin Lakes, Wisconsin. I am currently enrolled as an undergraduate student at Metropolitan State University of Denver and pursuing a degree in Environmental Science. After I graduate, I hope to pursue a career that involves something that will make a positive impact on the environment, no matter how big or small. During my free time, I enjoy spending time outdoors, playing guitar and ukulele, and spending time with friends and family.  

I am looking forward to learning more about computer science during the ESIIL Stars internship and excited to learn how I can apply this knowledge to the environment. I am also excited to be working with a team focusing on research and learning valuable skills from individuals and the team.
